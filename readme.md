Brief overview of the files and folders in this directory\
The EM/ code uses pymaid 0.89, the NEURON/ code uses neuron with python 2.7

pymaid 0.89 is included here. To use:\
conda create -n turner-evans python=3.6\
cd pymaid-0.89/\
python setup.py install\
pip install pandas==1.0.4

### EM/

_pickled_neurons/_ - locally saved information from Catmaid for our neurons of interest.

_volume.py_ - class for working with collections of neurons using pymaid.\
_buildCX.py_ - constructs a 'volume' object with our neurons of interest from the data in pickled_data.\
_connectivity_matrices.py_ - generates connectivity matrices for the different compartments. (fig2E, fig3D, fig4D, fig5DEH, fig6DE, fig7DEF, figS7B, figS13A)\
_estimate_synapses_distributions.py_ - extrapolates connectivity information based on anatomy. Plots histograms. (figS3)\
_make_PB_EB_extrapolated_matrices.py_ - uses functions from estimate_synapses_distributions.py to make a simplified extrapolated connectivity matrix. (fig8B)\
_treeNeuron.py_ - turns a Catmaid neuron into a graph and writes it to a file for compatibility with the NEURON/ code.\
_run_all_code.py_ - runs the above scripts to generate the figures/data in the paper

_connectivity_distributions/_ - histograms of extrapolated and non-extrapolated connectivity counts (figures and .txt files)\
_connectivity_matrices/_ - combined and comparment-specific connectivity matrice (figures and .txt files)\
_extrapolated/_ - extrapolated EB/PB connectivity (pickled dict)\
_connectivity_matrices/extrapolated/_ extrapolated EB/PB connectivity matrices (figures and .txt files)

### NEURON/

_neurons/_ - neuron structures generated by EM/treeNeuron.py

_neuron_simulator.py_ - class for generating NEURON objects and running simulations based on files generated by EM/treeNeuron.py\
_experiment_functions.py_ - function for simulating input to and recording from PEN2 neurons to generate the figure/data in the paper (figS11LM)

_results/_ - results of the calculations in run by experiment_functions.py
