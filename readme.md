Brief overview of the files and folders in this directory

### EM/ 
*pickled_data/* - locally saved information from Catmaid for our neurons of interest.

*volume.py* - class for working with collections of neurons using pymaid.\
*buildCX.py* - constructs a 'volume' object with our neurons of interest from the data in pickled_data.\
*connectivity_matrices.py* - generates connectivity matrices for the different compartments. (fig2E, fig3D, fig4D, fig5DEH, fig6DE, fig7DEF, figS7B, figS13A)\
*estimate_synapses_distributions.py* - extrapolates connectivity information based on anatomy. Plots histograms. (figS3)\
*make_PB_EB_extrapolated_matrices.py* - uses functions from estimate_synapses_distributions.py to make a simplified extrapolated connectivity matrix. (fig8B)\
*treeNeuron.py* - turns a Catmaid neuron into a graph and writes it to a file for compatibility with the NEURON/ code.\
*run_all_code.py* - runs the above scripts to generate the figures/data in the paper

*connectivity_distributions/* - histograms of extrapolated and non-extrapolated connectivity counts (figures and .txt files)\
*connectivity_matrices/* - combined and comparment-specific connectivity matrice (figures and .txt files)\
*extrapolated/* - extrapolated EB/PB connectivity (pickled dict)\
*connectivity_matrices/extrapolated/* extrapolated EB/PB connectivity matrices (figures and .txt files)



### NEURON/ 
*neurons/* - neuron structures generated by EM/treeNeuron.py

*neuron_simulator.py* - class for generating NEURON objects and running simulations based on files generated by EM/treeNeuron.py\
*experiment_functions.py* - function for simulating input to and recording from PEN2 neurons to generate the figure/data in the paper (figS11LM)

*results/* - results of the calculations in run by experiment_functions.py
